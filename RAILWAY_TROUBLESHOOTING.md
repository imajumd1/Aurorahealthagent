# Railway Troubleshooting Guide 🚨

## Current Issue: "Application failed to respond"

Your Railway app at https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/ is showing this error. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED**

I've just pushed critical fixes that should resolve the issue:

### ✅ **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Server Binding**: Changed from localhost to `0.0.0.0` (Railway requirement)
2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling around server startup
3. **Fallback Routes**: Added fallback for unhandled requests
4. **Environment Validation**: Better handling of missing environment variables
5. **Detailed Logging**: Added startup logs for debugging

### ✅ **Testing Confirmed:**
- Aurora works without OpenAI API key (uses knowledge base only)
- All core functionality tested and working
- Server starts successfully on Railway-compatible configuration

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (Do These Now):**

### 1. **Wait for Railway to Redeploy** (2-3 minutes)
The fixes have been pushed to GitHub. Railway should automatically redeploy.

### 2. **Check Railway Logs**
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the "Logs" tab

**Expected logs you should see:**
```
🚀 Starting Aurora Autism Assistant...
📊 Environment: production
🌐 Port: [Railway assigned port]
🧩 Aurora Autism Assistant running on port [port]
🔗 Health check: http://localhost:[port]/health
🌐 Web interface: http://localhost:[port]
🤖 Ready to help with autism-related questions!
📊 Server started successfully at [timestamp]
```

### 3. **Test Your Deployment**
Once redeployed, test these URLs:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/health

# Test web interface
open https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/

# Test API
curl -X POST https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is autism?"}'
```

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check Railway Logs for These Errors:**

1. **Port Issues:**
   ```
   Error: listen EADDRINUSE
   ```
   **Solution**: Railway should handle this automatically now

2. **Missing Dependencies:**
   ```
   Error: Cannot find module
   ```
   **Solution**: Railway should install dependencies automatically

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY not found
   ```
   **Solution**: This is just a warning - the app will work with knowledge base only

4. **CORS Issues:**
   ```
   CORS error
   ```
   **Solution**: Fixed in the latest update

### **Manual Redeploy (If Needed):**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" button

### **Force New Deployment:**
1. Make a small change to any file (like adding a space)
2. Commit and push to trigger a new deployment

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix:**

✅ **Health Endpoint**: `{"status":"ok","service":"Aurora Autism Assistant"...}`  
✅ **Web Interface**: Loads the Aurora chat interface  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints respond correctly  
✅ **Feedback System**: Thumbs up/down buttons work  
✅ **File Upload**: File upload functionality works  

## 📞 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check Railway Status**: https://status.railway.app/
2. **Railway Support**: Use the "Help Station" link in Railway dashboard
3. **GitHub Issues**: Check if there are any open issues in the repository

## 🧪 **Local Testing (Optional):**

You can test the exact Railway configuration locally:

```bash
# Test deployment readiness
node test-deployment.js

# Test with Railway-like environment
NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000 node server.js
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Your App:**

Once working, you can monitor:
- **Health**: https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Analytics**: https://aurorahealthagent-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics
- **Railway Metrics**: Check Railway dashboard for CPU, memory, and request metrics

**The fixes I've applied should resolve the "Application failed to respond" error. Your Aurora Health Agent should be working within 2-3 minutes of the automatic redeploy!** 🧩✨
