npm install
```

```

### 3. Start Aurora
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in Browser
Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Test Aurora

### ‚úÖ Autism-Related (Should get detailed responses)
- "What are early signs of autism in toddlers?"
- "How do I help with sensory overload?"
- "What accommodations help in school?"
- "wat r som comunication stratgies?" (testing typo handling)

### ‚ùå Off-Topic (Should politely redirect)
- "What's the weather like?"
- "How do I cook pasta?"
- "Tell me about dogs"

## API Testing

```bash
# Test the main endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are sensory strategies for autism?"}'

# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not configured"**
- Make sure your `.env` file has `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key`

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
- Add `PORT=3001` to your `.env` file or kill the process using port 3000

**"Cannot find module"**
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

**Frontend not loading**
- Check that the server started successfully
- Try refreshing the browser page
