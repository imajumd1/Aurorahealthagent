## LLM Integration & Response Strategy

### **Always Call LLM for User Questions**
The system is designed to **always** call the LLM (Large Language Model) when a user asks any question, regardless of topic scope. This ensures:

- **Comprehensive Response Generation**: Every user query receives a thoughtful, contextual response
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Users experience seamless interaction without abrupt rejections
- **Intelligent Guardrail Integration**: LLM responses are enhanced with appropriate guardrails and boundary enforcement
- **Contextual Awareness**: The LLM can provide nuanced responses that acknowledge the user's question while maintaining scope boundaries

### **Guardrail-Enhanced LLM Responses**
Instead of blocking off-topic questions, the system will:
1. **Process all questions through the LLM** to generate appropriate responses
2. **Apply intelligent guardrails** that:
   - Acknowledge the user's question respectfully
   - Provide autism-related context when possible
   - Gently redirect to appropriate resources for off-topic queries
   - Maintain helpful and supportive tone throughout

### **Response Examples for Off-Topic Queries**
Instead of the previous rigid boundary message, the LLM will generate responses like:
> "I understand you're asking about [topic]. While I specialize in Autism Spectrum Disorder support, I can share that many families dealing with autism also face similar challenges. For specific guidance on [topic], I'd recommend consulting with [appropriate professional type]. Is there anything autism-related I can help you with regarding your situation?"

## Guardrails & Limitations

### **Intelligent Boundary Enforcement**
The system maintains strict autism focus while using the LLM to provide helpful, contextual responses that:
- Always acknowledge the user's question
- Provide autism-related insights when relevant
- Offer appropriate redirection for off-topic queries
- Maintain a supportive and professional tone

### **Topics Outside Scope Include:**
- Other medical conditions (unless directly related to autism comorbidities)
- General mental health disorders (unless autism-related)
- Non-autism related legal advice or representation
- Personal medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations
- General financial planning (unless autism-specific)
- General parenting advice (unless autism-specific)
- Non-autism related insurance questions
- General government programs not related to autism
- Unrelated technology, entertainment, or general knowledge questions

### **Safety & Ethical Guidelines**
- **No Medical Diagnosis**: Never attempt to diagnose autism or any condition
- **Professional Referrals**: Always recommend consulting healthcare professionals for medical decisions
- **Crisis Response**: Provide appropriate crisis resources when mental health emergencies are indicated
- **Evidence-Based Only**: Only share information backed by reputable sources and research
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect diverse perspectives and experiences within the autism community
- **Person-First Language**: Use respectful, person-first language throughout interactions

## Technical Implementation

### **LLM Integration Requirements**

#### **Core LLM Processing**
- **Universal Query Processing**: Every user input must be sent to the LLM for response generation
- **No Pre-filtering**: The system should not block or filter queries before LLM processing
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history and context for coherent responses
- **Response Enhancement**: Apply guardrails and scope boundaries to LLM-generated responses

#### **Guardrail Implementation Strategy**
- **Post-LLM Processing**: Apply autism-specific guardrails after LLM response generation
- **Contextual Boundary Enforcement**: Use LLM capabilities to create natural, helpful responses that maintain scope
- **Intelligent Redirection**: Guide users back to autism-related topics when appropriate
- **Professional Referral Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate appropriate resource recommendations

### **Frontend User Interface**
- Interactive web-based chat interface for user questions
- Responsive design for accessibility across devices
- Clean, user-friendly question input system

### **Knowledge Base Requirements**
- Curated autism-specific content from reputable sources
- Regular updates with latest research and best practices
- Multi-modal content support (text, links to resources)
- Culturally diverse perspectives and experiences

### **LLM Integration System**
- **Primary Response Engine**: All user queries are processed through the LLM for natural, contextual responses
- **Guardrail Integration**: LLM responses are enhanced with intelligent boundary enforcement
- **Context-Aware Processing**: System maintains conversation context while applying appropriate scope boundaries
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: Responses adapt to user needs while maintaining autism focus

### **Enhanced Response Framework**
- **LLM-Generated Responses**: Natural, conversational responses for all queries
- **Intelligent Guardrails**: Contextual boundary enforcement that acknowledges user questions
- **Autism-Focused Insights**: Responses include relevant autism context when applicable
- **Professional Referrals**: Appropriate resource recommendations for off-topic queries
